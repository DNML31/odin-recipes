    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Great pastrami is not the easiest thing to find west of the Catskills, so a few years ago I embarked
        on a mission to find a way to turn the common corned beef into something similar. My goal was to come
        up with a reasonable substitute that could be done in less than a day at home, without a smoker, or any
        other special equipment. Impossible? No!<p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coarsely ground fresh black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 pounds corned beef brisket</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4><p>

        <li>Cover baking sheet with a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Coat aluminum foil with prepared garlic oil.

        <li>Cover all sides of corned beef brisket completely with pepper mixture, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons.</li>
        <li>With fat side of corned beef brisket up, wrap in the sheet of aluminum foil. Place wrapped corned beef on another
