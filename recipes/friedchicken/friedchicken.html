    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) frying chicken, cut up</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery seeds</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
        <li>2 cups Kikkoman Tempura Batter Mix</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, garlic powder,
            onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery seeds. Place chicken in buttermilk mixture
            and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Drain chicken in a colander
            to remove excess buttermilk. Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken.
            Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken with tempura batter mix. Remove chicken
            and fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes. Continue to fry, turning occasionally,
            until browned on all sides.</li>
    </ol>
