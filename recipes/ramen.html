    <h1>Ramen</h1>

    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

    <p>Inspired by the shoyu ramen at my favorite restaurant, this is my ideal ramen. If you want to make it pescatarian, I suggest
        foregoing the pork belly for bonito flakes -- just a big pinch in each bowl.
    </p>
    <p>Recipe by Maya Papaya Zimmerman off of allrecipes.com.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup dried black fungus</li>   
        <li>2 cups mirin</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups soy sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 green onion bulbs, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>2 pounds skin-on, boneless pork belly</li>
        <li>butcher's twine</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup miso plate</li>
        <li>4 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 naruto (fish paste stick with a red spiral pattern). sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place black fungus in a large bowl and fill with water.</li>
        <li>combine mirin, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 green onion bulbs, chopped onion, and garlic in an
            oven-safe pot over high heat. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place pork belly skin-side down on a flat work surface. Roll up lengthwise and wrap with butcher's twine.
            Place pork belly in the pot with the mirin mixture and partially cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pork is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads
            at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring a separate pot of water to a boil over high heat. Gently place eggs in the pot and cook until yolks are
            barely set, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl filled with ice water. Let sit, about 1 minute. Remove 
            from water and peel eggs.</li>
        <li>Place eggs in a container with 1 cup water, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Dampen a paper
            towel in the mixture and use it to cover the container. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Skim fungus from the top of the pork belly mixture and place in a pot with 8 cups water; fungus should be covered
            in pork belly fat. Add 1/4 cup soy sauce and miso paste. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Remove skin from the pork belly using a knife. Chop the meat into pieces of desired thickness. Cut eggs in half
            lengthwise</li>
        <li>Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are
            tender, yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place 4 slices of nori diagonally in the corner of each bowl. Place noodles on top; arrange 2 egg halves and a few
            pork belly slices in separate corners. Cover with black fungus, top with green onions, and pour in broth. Top each
            bowl with a few slices of naruto. Let sit, about 3 minutes, before serving.</li>
    </ol>
